What a great day to go to the store
Where did the store go?
Swear it was somewhere around here
Maybe it was here
No not here either. Where could it be?
Please don't tell me the store was closed
I will climb higher if I have to
These are cool. I should buy one.
Perhaps I could go to a different store.
This store is completely gone aswell
That's because I destroyed them.
What the hell! Who are you?!?
I am the Saviour
I have heard great tales of you Shia.
Once I take you down the world will be mine.
We will see about that
The new world order will save all
I gather you also desroyed the path
Yes. The green stuff is a aftereffect
Also radioactive just like soceity.
ok
Wrong way
Your efforts are pointless
Just DIE already
The corrupt system will end with your death
shut up
What is with this tetris block landscape?
I'm unsure. This wasn't by me
Temporary truce to figure this out?
NEVER!!! You privileged degenerate
I just wanted cheese
There is also nothing to kill me here
Incorrect. There are more radioactive blocks but slightly different
Who could have placed those?
It was me who layed them
Who dares interrupt our conflict?!?
I am the saviour and I will make this nation great again
I know you. You will bring the nation to ruins!
What does this have to do with me? (I really don't care)
Everything
I'm sorry Shia but the new way is killing us
You must die to show the correct path
This is all lies. The old way was far worse
Seriously what does this have to do with me?
That's not a answer
Seriously. Just tell me how this is related to me?
Leave Fake Saviour. His death is MINE!
Your levels are far inferior to mine.
All yours look the same
(They are ignoring me)
What were you saying about my levels being the same?
Doesn't change who you are, you degenerate!
How am I the degenerate, you rentoid?
Not even a real word
You're both annoying
HOW DARE YOU!
Now you decide to listen to me
Don't move once you touch the first block btw
Who is this now?
The saviour of unlimited intellect
For now though I will go easy on you
Gotta admit those speed boost blocks are cool
Many Thanks my Guy
This one is harder btw. You can't stay still
Silence deceiver
What am I deceiving you about?
You claimed you were the Saviour when that is me
Nah its me
You two failed. Why are you even still here?
I am merely waiting for you two idiots to leave
You gave the least challenge out of us
Yeah you should leave
Fine I will you degenerates
He is finally gone
Now you are facing my ULTIMATE level
Bad level design. Doesn't look fun at all
Whatever. Lets team up for the final one
Sure
We won't talk for your concentration
Its only fair
Ok stop talking
Finally the store
